# Railway Crossing Controller – Verilog RTL

## Description
This project implements a basic railway crossing controller using Verilog HDL.
The controller closes the gate and switches the signal when a train is detected.

## Features
- Synchronous design using clock and reset
- Train detection input
- Gate control output
- Signal control output

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog (Simulation)
- GTKWave (Waveform Analysis)

## Simulation
The design was verified using a custom testbench and simulated in GTKWave.

## Future Improvements
- Implement FSM-based control logic
- Add multiple train sensors
- Introduce realistic timing delays
- Add pedestrian/road traffic logic
